''' Given an integer n , create a two-dimensional array of size (n√ón) 
    and populate it as follows, with spaces between each character:
        The positions on the minor diagonal (from the upper right to the lower left corner) receive 1 .
        The positions above this diagonal recieve 0 .
        The positions below the diagonal receive 2 .
    Print the elements of the resulting array. '''
