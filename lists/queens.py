''' In chess it is known that it is possible to place 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chess board such that 
    none of them can attack another. Given a placement of 8 queens on the board, 
    determine if there is a pair of queens that can attach each other on the next move. 
    Print the word NO if no queen can attack another, otherwise print YES. 
    The input consists of eight coordinate pairs, one pair per line, with each pair giving the 
    position of a queen on a standard chess board with rows and columns numbered starting at 1. '''
